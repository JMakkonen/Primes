# Primes
Ruby Prime Calculation

### Overview
This program was an exercise for programming in Ruby.  There are two parts.  The first is Primes.r which creates a file that contains a set number of primes.  There is no user interaction involved.  If you want more or less primes, you need to change the number in the do loop in the program.  If I get a chance I might add in some prompts for how many primes to create and a filename.  User data input validation will be an issue though.

The second part is the CheckPrime.r program.  It first reads in the data file generated by Primes.r.  The first entry in the data file is the number of primes the file holds.  If there was an "while (!EOF)" structure...
Anyway, the program then asks for a number and then proceeds to check if it is prime.  Again, I added a basic check on the max size, but need to add some more user input validations... nothing less than 2, and it has to be an integer.
Can you round a floating point variable in Ruby by x = x.to_i.to_f ?
